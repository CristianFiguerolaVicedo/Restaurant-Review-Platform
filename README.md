## Setup front-end dependencies

Before doing anything we have to install the dependencies for the front-end to work.
To do this, first, we have to locate ourselves in the front-end directory by running the following command in the terminal: `cd ./front`.

After running this command we have to install the required dependencies for the front-end to work: `npm install`.

## Run everything.

After installing the dependencies, we have to run docker, our front-end and our springboot application.

To do this we will first run docker on another terminal by running the following command: `docker-compose up`.

After this, we will run our springboot application by going to the RestaurantApplication file and running it.

Finally we have to run our front-end by going again to the front-end directory and running `npm run dev`.

Now, we only have to click the link that appears and we will be able to use the application.
